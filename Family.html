     <p> Growing up I was lucky enough to share the same neighborhood with my cousins who are close in my age, although I do not have any sisters I consider these two girls to be the closest thing I have to a sister as I have always maintained a good relationship with my cousins.</p>

     <p> This is a photograph of my favorite person in the world and myself. I have been blessed to have the ability to have such a great relationship with my grandfather(PA) as I grew up in the same neighborhood as my grandparents. With that said, PA has exhibited what being optimistic is all about as he has faced a lot of adversity in his battle with Parkinson's disease. It is very difficult to witness this disease degrade his quality of life as there is no cure. Nonetheless, he always reinforced his idea that "Growing old is mandatory but growing up is optional.  </p>
